Title: SmartFIFO â€“ Configurable Synchronous FIFO with SystemVerilog Verification

Key Features:
Parameterized width and depth (using parameter WIDTH, DEPTH)

Full/empty flags, overflow/underflow protection

Synchronous read/write logic with handshaking

Designed in Verilog

Verified using SystemVerilog testbench + assertions + functional coverage


Why it's important:
FIFO is a core building block in SoCs (used in AXI, interconnects)

Tests your RTL + DV skills: edge-case handling, corner coverage

You can add Scoreboard + Assertions to show real DV flow
