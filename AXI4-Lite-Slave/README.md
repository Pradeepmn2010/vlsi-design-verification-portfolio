Title: AXI4-Lite Slave – Synthesizable IP with Protocol Verification

Key Features:
Implements a basic AXI4-Lite Slave interface (read/write channels)

Read/write registers using address decoding

Handshaking logic using valid / ready signals

Functional verification using a SystemVerilog testbench

Protocol checker: assertions to check handshake, response timing


Why it's important:
AXI4 is the industry-standard bus protocol

Used in CPUs, SoCs, accelerators — most companies test AXI understanding

Great for protocol-level DV (scoreboard, functional coverage)
