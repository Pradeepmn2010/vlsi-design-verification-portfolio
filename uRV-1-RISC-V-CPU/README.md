Title: uRV-1 â€“ Minimalistic RV32I RISC-V CPU Core

Key Features:
Implements a single-cycle RISC-V core (RV32I base ISA)

Modules: Instruction Fetch, Decode, ALU, Register File, Memory

Can run simple programs from memory

Written in Verilog, with modular architecture

Verified with a SystemVerilog testbench (instruction-level testing)

Why it's important:
Demonstrates Computer Architecture + RTL Design skills

Great for RTL + DV roles at AMD, Qualcomm, Synopsys, etc.

Lets you showcase control/data path, FSMs, and ALU design
